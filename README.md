## Foundings based on practical windsurf usage:
- windsurf is a tool and it uses agent called cascade.
- Agents based where they chaining the action.
- Agents still need humans to scope out the problem, bring them up to speed and review large code changes.
- cascade is a collaborative agent - Context awareness and Human action tracking(can also be used as input into LLM to determine what tool to be called next)
